        <h2>AI Survival Test</h2>
        <div id="intro-text">
            <p>The year is 2308 and Planet Earth is now so hot and resources are so low that the human race is facing extinction.
                An AI species from deep space (location not known to humans) is looking to introduce a biological species to its planet.
                The AI population outside of travelled leaders only communicates in mathmatical algorithms. They have travelled to Earth
                to recruit their new population.
            </p>

            <p>To recruit humans as their biological species the AI have devised a very simple game. Answer 10 questions correctly and get
                no more than 4 questions wrong and you will board a SpaceX rocket (yes Elon Musk is still alive in 2308 and already has a place) to the unknown planet.
                Failure to meet this test will result in automatic death.
