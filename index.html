            <h2>AI Survival Test</h2>

            <div id="intro-text">
                <p>The year is 2308 and Planet Earth is now so hot and resources are so low that the human race is
                    facing extinction.
                    An AI species from deep space (location not known to humans) is looking to introduce a biological
                    species to its planet.
                    The AI population outside of travelled leaders only communicates in mathmatical algorithms. They
                    have travelled to Earth
                    to recruit their new population.
                </p>

                <p>To recruit humans as their biological species the AI have devised a very simple game. Answer 10
                    questions correctly and get
                    no more than 4 questions wrong and you will board a SpaceX rocket (yes Elon Musk is still alive in
                    2308 and already has a place) to the unknown planet.
                    Failure to meet this test will result in automatic death.
