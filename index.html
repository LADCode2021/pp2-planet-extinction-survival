            <div class="intro-text">
                <p class="intro">The year is 2408 and Planet Earth is riddled with natural disasters and resources are
                    at an all time low. The human race will be extinct within weeks. An unknown AI species from deep in
                    space has offered the biological species access to their planet. However, upon arriving at Planet
                    Earth they could not register the population mass so will only permit a spot on their rocket to
                    those who can communicate in their language - mathmatical algorithms. Congratulations on finding
                    this station. This is your chance of escaping from your impending demise and a shot at survival.
                </p>

                <p class="intro">To recruit humans as their biological species who can communicate in mathematical
                    algorithms, the AI has devised a very simple test. Answer 6 out of 10 questions correctly and you
                    will be rewarded with a spot on the SpaceX rocket to the International Space Station (yes Elon
                    Musk is still alive in 2408 and already has a space). From there your onward trip to deep space will
                    begin. Failure to pass this test will result in your denied access and so, you will be left on
                    Planet Earth. Good luck, seriously.
