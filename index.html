                <p class="intro">The year is 2308 and Planet Earth is now so hot and resources are so low that the
                    human race is facing extinction. An AI species from deep space (location not known to humans) is
                    looking to introduce a biological species to its planet. The AI population outside of travelled
                    leaders only communicates in mathmatical algorithms. They have travelled to Earth to recruit
                    their new population.
                </p>

                <p class="intro">To recruit humans as their biological species the AI have devised a very simple
                    test. Answer 6 out of 10 questions correctly and get no more than 4 questions wrong and you will
                    board a
                    SpaceX rocket (yes Elon Musk is still alive in 2308 and already has a place) to the International
                    Space Station to await your trip to the unknown planet. Failure to meet this test will result in
                    automatic death.
