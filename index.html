                    <p class="intro">The year is 2308 and Planet Earth is now so hot and resources are so low that the
                        human race is
                        facing extinction.
                        An AI species from deep space (location not known to humans) is looking to introduce a
                        biological
                        species to its planet.
                        The AI population outside of travelled leaders only communicates in mathmatical algorithms. They
                        have travelled to Earth
                        to recruit their new population.
                    </p>

                    <p class="intro">To recruit humans as their biological species the AI have devised a very simple
                        game. Answer 10
                        questions correctly and get
                        no more than 4 questions wrong and you will board a SpaceX rocket (yes Elon Musk is still alive
                        in
                        2308 and already has a place) to the unknown planet.
                        Failure to meet this test will result in automatic death.
